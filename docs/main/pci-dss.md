# PCI-DSS
Every organization that handles card payments must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Annual compliance is mandated by the payment card schemes and banks.

### What is PCI DSS?
PCI DSS is a global standard, helping to protect cardholder data and tackle the growing threat of security breaches. It sets the operational and technical requirements for organizations handling card payments, and for software developers and manufacturers of payment applications and devices.

Zenith Payment's entire infrastructure is fully compliant with PCI DSS - we are certified at Level 1, which is the highest level of compliance. We are independently audited annually for compliance by qualified security assessors.

### What this means for you?
Whilst Zenith Payments is a PCI DSS compliant organisation, if your organization does accept card payments then it must also be fully compliant. Non-compliance with PCI DSS could make you responsible for any losses through fraud, and you may also face considerable fines from the card schemes and banks.

There are four levels of compliance, dependant on how many transactions are processed by your organisation in a year. Find out how your organisation can reach compliance at the [PCI Security Standards Council Website](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security)

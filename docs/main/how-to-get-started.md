# How To Get Started

Engage with us through these five key stages of integration:

1. **Discuss your requirements with our payments specialists.**
2. **Apply for a sandbox account.**
3. **Development.**
4. **Demo.**
5. **Production Sign Off.**

### Sandbox Account Application
Begin by discussing your specific business and technology needs with us. Our team of **Payment Specialists** will guide you to the appropriate solutions tailored to your requirements.

Our specialists will also assist you in applying for a sandbox account and obtaining API credentials.
- Australia: [integrations@zenithpayments.com.au](mailto:integrations@zenithpayments.com.au)
- New Zealand: *Coming soon* (please check back for updates).

### Getting Your API Credentials
Upon completing our initial meeting, we will provide you with your personalized Sandbox API credentials, which include a username, a password, and an API-Key for Merchant APIs.
For Customer APIs, generate a bearer token directly from the customer portal.
<br></br>Utilize your sandbox credentials with the <RedBoldText>Run in Postman</RedBoldText> link provided above, ensuring to select your desired language in the examples.
